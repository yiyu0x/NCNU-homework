  This exercise, pass 2, completes the assembler.

  The input of this exercise are two files, SYMTAB and INTFILE, 
  which are the output of the previous exercise.

  The output of this exercise, the object file,  should be printed to 
  the stdout. 

  Your program should be named exer5.cpp, exer5.cc or exer5.c.

  Assuming you have written exer4.cpp and exer5.cpp, you may test your 
  programs as follows.

    $ g++ -o pass1 exer4.cpp         # compile pass1
    $ g++ -o pass2 exer5.cpp         # compile pass2
    $ cat SAMPLE-split-1 | ./pass1   # run pass1; SYMTAB and INTFILE generated
    $ ./pass2                        # run pass2; the output is shown on
    H....                            #    the stdout, that is, the screen
    T....
    ....

    $ ./pass2 > DEVF2                # run pass2 again, but this time the
                                     #  output is redirected to a file
    $ ./sim                          # run the simulator to test it
    ....                             # Other DEV?? files must be prepared.
    $


  If you do not have an runnable exer4, you can still test your program.

    $ cp SAMPLE-SYMTAB-1  SYMTAB     # test your pass2 for SAMPLE 1
    $ cp SAMPLE-INTFILE-1 INTFILE
    $ ./pass2 
    ......
    $


  Note: There is no SAMPLE output for this exercise since the object
        file is not unique and you can just verify your object file
        with the simulator. (That is, run it!)
