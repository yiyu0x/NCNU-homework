hi all:
  This exercise asks you to write a C or C++ program which reads from stdin and
writes to stdout. The program just copies the input characters to output.

  Note: 
    0: Your program should be named as exer2.c or exer2.cc or exer2.cpp.
    1: Your program should NOT open a new file. Use stdin and stdout (C)
       or cin and cout (C++).
    2: To compile a C program, use gcc or clang.
       ex:  gcc your-c-program.c
       ex:  clang your-c-program.c
    3: To compile a C++ program, use g++ or clang++.
       ex:  g++ your-c-program.cpp
       ex:  clang++ your-c-program.cpp
    4: Just type ./a.out to run.
       The program should read a line and output a line.
       If you want to terminate the program, type ctrl-D for end-of-file.
       See examples below.
    5: You can also put the input in a file and use redirecting to run.
       See examples below.
        
--prompt--> gcc exer2.c 
--prompt--> ./a.out 
SIC is sic.         <------ this is what you enter
SIC is sic.         <------ this is the output
sic is not SIC.     <------ input
sic is not SIC.     <------ output, type ^D for 'end of file', 
                                    i.e., for terminating the program.
--prompt--> cat test-exer2.dat    <--- You can put your input in a file
I love SIC, but not sic.
It is sic which make me cry.
sisicsi
--prompt--> ./a.out < test-exer2.dat   <---- run with redirection
I love SIC, but not sic.               <---- The output should just be
It is sic which make me cry.           <---- the same the input.
